**Please use the issue template below. Issues not using the templates will likely be closed without warning! If you are suggesting a feature you do not need to follow the template.**

If you're having config issues (such as it resetting) first make sure it's a valid YAML file using a [parser](http://yaml-online-parser.appspot.com).

### Debug Info

Due to a change in the GitHub Gist API the debug command currently doesn't work. Please can you upload your `config.yml` and provide your Bukkit version. If possible a plugin list and providing your `data.yml` is also appreciated and may be requested if needed.

### Link/paste of stack trace/error (if any)

    You can also simply just use code formatting in markdown!
___We need all of the stack trace! Do not cut off parts of it.___

### Actions to reproduce (if known):
___This may include a build schematic, a video, or detailed instructions to help reconstruct the issue___
